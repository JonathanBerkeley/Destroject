# Destroject
Windows multiple DLL process injector     

# Usage
1. Place injector in a folder with DLL(s)    
2. Open a command prompt / powershell in the folder     
3. For first time launch, execute injector through command-line arguments with the name of the target process. E.G:    
   C:\Users\Me> destroject.exe "ProcessName"    

After running the first time through command-line, it will save the last entered process.    
To inject into the same process again, the injector can just be run directly.    
To inject into a different process, do Step 3 again.
